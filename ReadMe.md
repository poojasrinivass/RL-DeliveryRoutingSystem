### Product: NoDelayWorry

We aim to automate the process of delivery routing of trucks such that, the fuel cost is minimized and the customer satisfaction is maximized. Customer Satisfaction is achieved by ensuring the availability of good quality(fresh) inventory at shops. This is achieved by ensuring the trucks reach the shops without delay and reach the goal with minimum fuel costs.
